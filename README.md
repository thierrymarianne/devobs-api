Easing observation of Twitter lists related to software development

## Installation

The shell scripts written to install the project dependencies have been tested under Ubuntu 16.04.5 LTS.
My guess about running them from another OS would be that it simply won't terminate as expected.

### Requirements

Install git by following instructions from the [official documentation](https://git-scm.org/).
